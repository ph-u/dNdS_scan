# dNdS gene-by-gene comparative genomics pipeline

## Computational requirements

1. install ```blastn``` program from NCBI, program within `dNdSGenome` directory
0. Use Genbank annotated database (GCA_*)
0. construct NCBI databases, one genome one database, all files (including the raw genomic file (with extension `.fna`) store within `dNdSGenome` directory
